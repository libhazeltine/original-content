# Integrated Scanning Practice

This is an experimental system for training psionic perception by maintaining observation of the visual+spatial physical senses, and simultaneously observing the same information streams from the psionic senses, tuned to the immediate environment. 

The two layers of this are **observation** (continous monitoring of both the physical and psionic senses and the information they provide), and **error checking** (detecting and correcting inconsistencies between the two data sources, as frequently as possible)

Both of these routines are to be heavily integrated with the expansion of the [internal framework for semi-local travels](clouddocs:///Documents/Ventures/), as testing is to mainly be done during such travels.
