# Hazel Support Framework

This is an evolution of the core ideas backing the former *Construct Infrastructure Deployment Service* [ [1](https://canary.discord.com/channels/1071814425574645830/1169847518276890654/1169849425380769852), [2](x-apple-cloudkit://com.apple.Notes/Notes/Hazel%20CIDS#231029) ] internal project, originally intended to serve as a general purpose system for gathering energy for constructs that scale beyond the energy capacity of a single person.

The intended use of this project is now solely for the deployment of constructs that manifest the success of all other Hazel subprojects. Other uses are no longer planned to be supported. The original specification can be found [here.](./ARCHIVE-cids.md) (public link)

Past implementations irrelevant, the idea behind HSF is to:
1. Design storage ("primary") and capture ("secondary") constructs, for accessing ambient energy from public locations and storing them in a nearby abandoned/vacant structure.
2. Generate "anchors" for these constructs using CXHash, an internal application for generating sigil-like images from text by applying custom logic on top of a hashing algorithm
3. Deploy such anchors to locations as defined in the [private database](https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0f9_t9GIDQqWTFV1P9zmlBZig).
4. Repeat this process on the first Tuesday of each month, and keep detailed [internal records](clouddocs:///Documents/Metaphysics/Infrastructure/hazelsupportframework.internal/).
