# (WIP, 23L18) Hazel Support Framework

This is an evolution of the core ideas backing the former *Construct Infrastructure Deployment Service* [ [1](https://canary.discord.com/channels/1071814425574645830/1169847518276890654/1169849425380769852), [2](x-apple-cloudkit://com.apple.Notes/Notes/Hazel%20IDS#231029) ] internal project, originally intended to serve as a general purpose system for gathering energy for constructs that scale beyond .

Past implementations irrelevant, the idea behind HSF is to:
1. Deploy constructs to anchors, using CXHash, an internal application for generating sigil-like images from text by applying custom logic on top of a hashing algorithm
2. **yada yada, replace this.**
