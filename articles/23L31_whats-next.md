# What’s Next

January 20th, 2024 (or somewhere around that date) marks the one year milestone of the start of the earliest iteration of various experiments in psionics and related fields of metaphysics.

## Where We’re At Now
The intent of the initial experiments, to prove or disprove the core ideas of metaphysics at an individual, subjective level, has been completed for some time. Since then, a number of additional projects have been established to further my personal understanding of what’s possible, as well as my ability to actually engage with these concepts directly. These are collectively referred to as Project Hazel.

In parallel, I had discovered a large amount of Wayback Machine archived documentation files on former web forums and blogs that seemingly died with the broader shift to a centralized internet. This discovery led to another set of initiatives called Hazeltine, with the primary objectives being manual backups of information I found useful on those sites into a public Library (as there was paranoia about the IA being forced to shut down at this time), and the attempted establishment of a new community known as the Village, meant to fill the hole left by the demise of the network of former websites.

Hazeltine Village was a failure. What i hadn’t realized is that ~ in the vast majority of cases ~ the same rejection of mainstream that leads to extensive interest in psionics also leads to very nonstandard social behaviors. The environment on that server was not only nonproductive psionics wise but also in a state where all social interaction was either boring small talk or outright insane arguments. 


## Where We’d Like to Go
In 2024, Hazel will continue to move towards an individual first practice, at least for the time being. However, a long term vision for a knowledge oriented psionic community is still here, and different ways of accomplishing this in the future may be considered.

A crucial component is a solid, shared knowledge base, in this case being the [Hazeltine Library](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine). Since August, I’ve been technically working on the Veritas Society Forums [release](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine/blob/main/index-domains.md), but not actually giving it the amount of effort it actually requires. 

I intend for the “vsociety” git branch and content release to be done by the 20th of February, 2024, at the latest. Additionally, I intend for the entire first “indexing” phase of the Library to be done by the end of 2024, at the latest, after which archiving will start.

And as announced in December, many smaller psionic research and development projects that would originally never be published under previous rules will now have a new home in //libhazeltine/original-content.

These projects, on the 2024 roadmap, include a background service for **training of access to visual information**, a new infrastructure platform for **energy gathering from remote sources**, and a long term extension of the aforementioned background service to include psychometric and other forms of **conceptual information about environments and situations**.

Additional unconfirmed ideas on the table include resumption of the short lived telekinetic experiments, as well as a new framework for using digital maps to establish **long distance psychic connections** to otherwise unknown locations, and a new written scripting language for pre-planned dreams.
