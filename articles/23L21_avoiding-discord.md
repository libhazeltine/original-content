# Avoiding Discord in favor of an open, knowledge-centric platform
*Jordan Silver, 21st December 2023*

Discord (the app) is a disease on the social framework of the open internet. The theme of "forums dying down in favor of Discord servers" that I often talk about goes way beyond psionics - it impacts effectively every internet community. 

This repository is a new home for my original writings related to psionics.
Its release is part of a broader effort to create a new public content ecosystem, and to solve problems that come from the widespread use of Discord, sometimes for purposes it was never meant to serve:

- Restriction of formerly public discussion archives
    - "Discussion" refers to productive conversation that is never formally documented, but is still indexed and used. 
    - The importance of archiving discussion is often overlooked when designing communities - one of the attractive features of Discord is unlimited storage of message history and attachments, enabling the responsibility of proper backups to be completely ignored
        - This results in problems in rare cases where archives DO get deleted and people haven’t prepared for this
- Restricted access to documentation 
    - “Documentation” refers to text content that was written with the intent to be preserved and used 
    - In the context of online communities, such documentation can be useful beyond the scope of specific groups
        - In psionics specifically, documentation produced by a network of historical communities is still accessible and useful after the communities have closed. See [The Hazeltine Library.](https://github.com/libhazeltine/libhazeltine)
        - But content siloed in Discord servers does not have the backing of the Wayback Machine, so archiving must be done while these communities are still active.
- Psionics community specific issues
    - At present, I am in 12 different metaphysical discords, in addition to DMs with people not in any servers, as well as servers where metaphysics is seen as secondary but still interesting.
        - These “distribution channels” have significant variance in metaphysical knowledge and skill, general personality, and other factors. Some of these groups outright hate each other and should not be interacting directly with one another.
        - Having a shared, linkable “source of truth” for my writings is an objectively superior approach to copy/pasting the same thing in any combination of ~15 different audiences.

The ultimate goal is to separate the research and development aspect of psionics, which I still believe is superior to formal parapsychology, with the problematic social aspects amplified by Discord. **This single repository is just the beginning.** In the coming weeks, I plan to create a system for other people within psionic groups to publish their work to either a subsection of here, their own github accounts, or even something else entirely. 
In addition, a more generic specification will also be published for other communities unrelated to psionics to employ these same practices.
