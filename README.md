# Hazel Original Content

Repository for original documents related to Project Hazel, the psionics and energy work practices of Jordan Silver.

Starting on the 21st of December, 2023, efforts to rebuild a broader psionic community have been mostly stopped. As part of these changes, the Hazeltine Village discord server is no longer in service. The core Library is unaffected and will continue to be developed.

In general, effort is being shifted towards mostly solo, internally developed experiments and projects with selective collaboration. Findings will be published to this repo for transparency reasons. Right now the planned projects (rev. 23L17) include the following:

* Integrated Scanning Practice (aka “bellingham”): Constant engagement and real-time validation of the perceptive sense, by using both energetic and physical means to sense the immediate environment, and cross referencing the data from these two systems, all in a “passive” manner that is meant to be done in a variety of physical settings and during day to day activities, beginning the day after this publication (12/22)
* Hazel Support Framework: Use of an internal construct design template (aka CIDS, “osborne”) to create “service” constructs to increase the success of all projects, beginning the 2nd of January, unless delayed.
* Hazel Intelligence Platform: Design and installation of a “service” construct to gather and keep queryable records of otherwise inaccessible information about events in my vicinity. Full details, including a start date, are TBD.

## Hours of Operation and Availability (for trusted partners)
Mondays and Wednesdays, after my work (4:30pm pacific), and occasionally all day on Tuesdays, are dedicated time for metaphysical practice, Library indexing/research, and other work on Hazel subprojects. I am available for telepathy and other psionic practice at these times ideally, but we can work out pretty much anything with advance notice.
