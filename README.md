# Hazel Original Content

Repository for original documents related to Project Hazel, the psionics and energy work practices of Jordan Silver.

Starting on the 21st of December, 2023, efforts to rebuild a broader psionic community have been mostly stopped. As part of these changes, the Hazeltine Village discord server is no longer in service. The core Library is unaffected and will continue to be developed.

In general, effort is being shifted towards mostly solo, internally developed experiments and projects with selective collaboration. Findings will be published to this repo for transparency reasons. Right now the planned projects (rev. 23L19) include the following (links below are public):

* [Integrated Scanning Practice](./projects/integrated-scanning/README.md)
* [Hazel Support Framework](./projects/support-framework/README.md)
* **Hazel Intelligence Platform**, design TBD
